# Jupyter Notebooks

Here be dragons (a.k.a. chicken scratch and vibe coded datasets and toy models generated during the development process)

If you want to use the [capstone](../artifacts/capstone/README.md) package in here, activate your virtualenv and pip install the wheel:

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install ../artifacts/capstone/dist/capstone-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
