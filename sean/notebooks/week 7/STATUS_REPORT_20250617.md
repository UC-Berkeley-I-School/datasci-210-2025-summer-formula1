## Model Experiments

### Models Tested

1. **Baseline Models**
   - **Majority Class Predictor**: Always predict "no safety car"
   - **Stratified Random**: Random predictions matching class distribution
   - **Simple Logistic Regression**: Current-state features only

2. **Primary Models**
   - **Logistic Regression (Balanced)**: Class-weighted logistic regression
   - **Random Forest (Balanced)**: Ensemble method with balanced classes
   - **Optimized Logistic Regression**: Manual class weight tuning

3. **Advanced Models**
   - **Temporal Logistic Regression**: Added time-series features
   - **Multi-Horizon Models**: Different prediction time windows

### Why These Models?

- **Started Simple**: Established baseline performance before adding complexity
- **Interpretability**: Need to understand which factors drive safety car deployments
- **Class Imbalance**: Safety cars are rare (4.4% of data) - required specialized handling
- **Real-time Constraints**: Models must make fast predictions during live races

## Data Split Strategies

### Experiments Conducted

1. **Random Split** (Initial - FAILED)
   - 80/20 train/test split
   - **Problem**: Temporal leakage (training on future, testing on past)
   - **Result**: Artificially inflated performance

2. **Temporal Split** (Improved)
   - Train: Earlier time periods
   - Test: Later time periods within same races
   - **Problem**: Still race-specific overfitting

3. **Race-Based Split** (Final Approach)
   - Train: 18 races (75%)
   - Test: 6 races (25%)
   - **Advantage**: Tests generalization to unseen tracks/conditions

### Validation Strategy
- **Cross-Race Validation**: Hold out entire races for testing
- **Time Series Cross-Validation**: 5-fold temporal splits
- **Robustness Testing**: Different race combinations

## Prediction Horizon Experiments

### Horizons Tested
| Horizon | Safety Car Rate | F1-Score | Precision | Recall | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 5 seconds | 0.28% | 0.017 | 0.008 | 0.942 | Too short - limited warning |
| **15 seconds** | **6.50%** | **0.252** | **0.149** | **0.799** | **Optimal balance** |
| 10 seconds | 3.85% | 0.218 | 0.127 | 0.761 | Good but less stable |
| 30 seconds | 3.09% | 0.111 | 0.059 | 0.906 | Too long - signal degrades |
| 60 seconds | 0.00% | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | No predictive signal |

### Key Findings
- **15-second horizon**: Sweet spot for prediction accuracy
- **Shorter horizons**: Higher recall but lower precision (too many false alarms)
- **Longer horizons**: Signal degrades, prediction becomes random
